WeStockApp - Chatting app that fetches stock quotes   

# Setup Guide
Install docker in your environment and type "docker pull rabbitmq" in the commandline, then to get it up running
type "docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit rabbitmq" 

Make sure to get angular ali globally typing -> "npm install -g @angular/cli" in the command line.

Once the docker RabbitMQ container is up running, go to WeStock.App's wwwroot -> webapp folder

Once that is done, start WeStock.Bot + WeStock.App together , to get everything running :)

And have fun! :)
